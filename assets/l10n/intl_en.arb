Vlorish carefully develops estimated taxes by taking into account all your income sources to determine tax brackets and credit availability before segregating self-employment income to calculate estimated taxes. Our goal is to provide you with the best estimate of your self-employment tax liability that will enable you to make timely estimated payments. ",
  "taxDisclaimerPartTwo": "The current version of Vlorish (2.0) estimated taxes calculator has an accuracy of 97%. That means, on average, Vlorish might overestimate or underestimate your taxes by no more than 3% compared to the estimate produced by your CPA. We're currently testing the next iteration of the Vlorish app (3.0) with embedded deep learning and proprietary state tax engine that have seen accuracy rates increase to the range of 98-99% over the broadest range of use cases. Due to the complexity of calculating future tax liabilities, estimates calculated by Vlorish are just estimates and may vary from your final tax amounts.",

  "budgetTips1": "Budgeting is a skill. Sometimes it’s the effect of good budgeting skills that can force financial discipline and healthy spending habits. Nine out of ten people who consider themselves “talented” at budgeting report substantial change in their overall financial happiness in as little as one year. Getting there requires learning the “Art” of budgeting, not just the science of it.Here is Vlorish’s list of the art of budgeting that can take anyone just starting out on budgeting from from zero to hero.",
  "opportunityCost": "Opportunity cost",
  "opportunityCostBody1": "A good budget requires user input in the form of initially setting up the budget and regularly “maintaining” the budget, which means periodically tracking spending, fixing overspending, setting up and tracking goals, debt payoff planning, investment, retirement, and net worth tracking and staying on top of estimates taxes for self-employed people. The problem with this is users are using multiple different systems to accomplish this, which presents them with a large opportunity cost or worse, completely discourages them from budgeting.\n\nOne of the principles that underpin Vlorish budgeting was to close this opportunity cost by reducing average monthly industry user spend-time from 12 hours to just 90-minutes in our platform. We have to reverse engineer the entire budgeting process to get to that point. Vlorish is the only app in the market that cross-links every aspect of your financial life from budgeting to retirement planning to taxes in a single platform. We deployed click-budgeting technology to reduce cumbersome multi-step processes into just a few clicks. To take advantage of Vlorish’s efficient budgeting and do away with opportunity cost, we suggest new users to watch the ",

  "here": "here",
  "budgetingWithIntent": "Budgeting with intent",
  "budgetingWithIntentBody": "Budgeting should never be an exercise of filling out spreadsheets or occasionally viewing quick snapshots. You should start budgeting with the intent of achieving clear goals such as reducing expenses by an x amount, boosting income or monthly savings by x amount, targeting specific spending categories for reduction, understanding the effect of debt & interest on your long-term financial standing, and setting up precise financial goals that are tracked and measured periodically. Before you set up your first budget, we suggest our users take15-30 minutes to predefine two short-term goals (1 year or less), two medium term goals (2-5), and one long-term goal (> 5 years).",
  "achievableGoals": "Achievable goals",
  "achievableGoalsBody": "When budgeting, especially if you are new to budgeting, it’s best to start with manageable goals that are well defined and limited in scope. For example,setting a goal to double your salary in one year is definitely possible but it’s closer to being unmet in the short-term and eventually upsetting  your budget goals. A more achievable target would be to create another income stream within6-months that will bring in $1,000 extra per month to pay off a credit card balance within that time frame. Similarly, setting a goal to fully fund your $5,000 emergence fund within 6-months by targeting and cutting costs across 2-3 specific expense categories. Proper goal setting and achieving those goals is the fuel to keep going and elevate to new highs every year.",
  "betterHabits": "Better Habits",
  "betterHabitsBody": "Financial planners often cite that disciplined budgeters who make a habit of regularly budgeting are the ones who reap the benefits of budgeting. We couldn’t agree more. Vlorish suggests our users stick to a predictable budgeting schedule, such as twice a week, 15-20 minutes each time. This will help you stay on top of all transactions, quickly developing actions around surprises and unexpected expenses, more importantly, holding yourself accountable to your goals.",
  "lessCash": "Less Cash",
  "lessCashBody": "Using cash to pay for things to save money is an old wives’ tale. Going fully digital with electronic payment such as debit cards, credit cards, direct debits/bank payments facilitate easier reconciliation, easier tracing of transactions, proper categorization of expenses, and let’s face it, remembering what it’s that money was spent on! Sophisticated budgeters avoid cash or check payments unless forced to.",

You should take advantage of this by studying every metric and setting improvements on areas that you have a rating of than 4. Peer Score™ is a competitive benchmark that measures your financial profile against broad economic metrics such as cost of living, age, etc. Peer Score™ also teaches users how to strike a balance between competing financial goals. A sophisticated user will strive to achieve balance through diversification,retirement planning, emergency funding, and cutting down debt. This is the methodology that underpins Peer Score™: identify all the components of a financial wellness and build achievable goals around them.",
  "betterBankingBody": "Using banks that have invested in technologies that connect their users seamlessly to personal financial apps such investing apps, budgeting apps, tax apps, etc, can have a positive impact of actualizing the benefits of better technology such as Vlorish that allow you take control of your personal finances.Personal finance is the fastest growing niche in the financial tech industry. Many banks have transformed their banking around these demands by customers to link their accounts with personal finance apps. On the other hand, few financial institutions such as small credit unions and community banks haven’t ventured out of their comfort zone, leaving their users to be in the dark. If you bank with financial institution of any kind that is among the 3% that don’t offer robust integrations with personal financials apps, it’s time to make the switch.",
  "mixAndMatch": "Mix and match",
  "mixAndMatchBody": "If you’re a freelancer or self-employed, tax pros strongly advise against mixing up your personal and business accounts. Maintaining a clear distinction between the two is not just required for tax compliance but is also helpful in confidently measuring both your personal and business performance and identifying areas of concerns with either one, without creating a haze around the other. To help you get there, Vlorish created separate personal and business budgets for self-employed individuals.",
  "billPayments": "Bill payments",
  "billPaymentsBody": "Synchronizing all your bills to a single day, permitting your financial means, is a less known strategy that has been popularized by Vlorish’ own team member who is a CPA. Those who perfected budgeting will tell you it’s one of the best secrets to controlling your spending, catching theft and unauthorized transactions right away, limiting the stress of bills to a single day. Many companies will claim they cannot alter due dates, but they very much can if you insist on it. We tried this as part of Vlorish research with test teams and convinced every single company to do just that, despite claims to the contrary.",
  "debtPayoffBody": "If you are one of millions of Americans who is saddled with debt such as student loans, and credit card debt, understanding two simple facts will propel you to action. The trouble with debt isn’t the debt itself but the interest. Interest is charged on 365.25 days out of the year. It’s very difficult to build wealth and create financial momentum if your hard earned dollars are going to interest expenses every month. Your priority should be getting out of debt as soon as practical, so you can focus on building assets and investments that create cash flow and wealth. Many financial planners push their users to focus paying off debt with the highest interest rate first, which produces the greatest mathematical value of interest avoided. Vlorish research shows the opposite, which is paying off many smaller debts first creates financial momentum and results less stress of having to service multiple debts. The opportunity cost of servicing numerous smaller debts far outweigh the benefits of saving a little interest on a single debt.",

  "whyDoesMyCreditCardPaymentShowAnegativeNumber": "Why does my credit card payment line on the budget page and on the debt page show a negative number?",
  "whyDoesMyCreditCardPaymentShowAnegativeNumberBody": "Vlorish calculates credit card payments on a net basis, meaning that your credit card payment is reduced by any interest charges and any additional purchases that you make on the card during the month to arrive at the net credit card payment that is shown on the budget? For example, if you made a $500 credit card payment but also put a $600 charge on your card and the credit card company charged you interest of $50 for the month, your net credit card payment is $500-$600-$50= -150, indicating further indebtedness as opposed to reduction in your debt.\n\nSo, if you see a negative credit card payment number, it means you have taken on more credit card debt for the month. Occasionally, you may have placed a charge at the beginning of the month and payment is scheduled at a later date in the month, the negative number will continue to be shown until a payment in excess of the purchases and interest is made at some point during the month.",
